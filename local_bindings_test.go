 * Assumes a locally running queue manager called QM1, with a defined local
 * queue called DEV.QUEUE.1
 *
 * Note: if you wish to prove that conclusively that the connection is being
 * made using bindings then one approach is to create a unique queue name such
 * as MY.LOCAL.QUEUE that exists only on the local queue manager, and update the
 * string name below to match - so that it cannot be confused with any other
 * queue manager that you might be able to connect to as a client.
